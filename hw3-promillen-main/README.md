# CS571-F23 HW3: Badger Bakery

Welcome back to Badger Bakery! In this homework, you'll create a new version of Badger Bakery using an API and React. In addition, you'll be fetching the bakery data rather than hardcoding it into the HTML. Finally, you will apply your knowledge of visual design to make a more eye-appealing webpage.

**Note:** The steps below show a barebones design. It's up to you (in the *visual design* portion of the assignment) to make a better design. See below for an *example* final solution.

## Setup

The starter code provided to you was generated using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). Furthermore, [bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap) and [react-bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap) have already been installed. **You should *not* re-run the  npm create vite command**. Instead, in this directory, simply run...

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then, in a browser, open `localhost:5173`. You should *not* open index.html in a browser; React works differently than traditional web programming! When you save your changes, they appear in the browser automatically. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to do your development work.

The two components you will be working with, `BadgerBakery.jsx` and `BakedGood.jsx`, are located in the `components` folder.

## React Fundamentals

### 0. Fetch Baked Goods

**This step has already been done for you!**

In `BadgerBakery.jsx`, we use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from the API and save it to a state variable `bakedGoods`. We then use `map` to display each `BakedGood`. In addition, we pass all four of the baked good attributes (`name`, `description`, `price`, and `featured`) to `BakedGood` as props.

In HW4, you will need to do something similar; for now this is given to you!

### 1. Display Baked Good Information

In `BakedGood.jsx`, in addition to the baked good's name, display its price and description.

![](_figures/step1.png)

### 2. Allow Adding/Removing of Baked Goods

In `BakedGood.jsx`, allow the user to be able to add and remove baked goods via the "+" and "-" buttons. Clicking "+" should increase the quantity while clicking "-" should decrease the quantity.

**Hint:** It may be helpful to replace the hardcoded 0 with a state variable which is changed by the `onClick` attribute of the buttons.

### 3. Prevent User Error

In `BakedGood.jsx`, add a `disabled` prop to the "-" button that disables the "-" button if the quantity is at or below `0`. There is no maximum number of items a user may add to their basket.

### 4. Highlight Featured Item

In `BakedGood.jsx`, highlight today's featured baked good by making its styling distinct from the other items. For example, you could change the background color, the font boldness, or anything else to distinguish it from the others.

A baked good is considered featured if its `featured` prop is `true`.

### 5. Fetch Featured Item

In `BadgerBakery.jsx`, display a line that says...

Today's featured item is ITEM for $PRICE!

...where ITEM and PRICE are replaced with the featured item name and price. You can do this by *either* (1) fetching the featured item from `https://cs571.org/api/f23/hw3/featured-baked-good` or (2) finding the featured item in the `bakedGoods` array. If you decide to find the featured item in the `bakedGoods` array, you may *not* assume the last item is the featured item; you must check for the `featured` prop.

You may assume that there is exactly 1 featured item at any given time. When the data is still fetching, simply display the text "Loading..." You will likely only see this loading text for a few milliseconds.

That's all for the React Fundamentals! There is no price/tax/total calculation in this assignment. Move on to **Visual Design**.

## Visual Design

Complete this part of the assignment *after* your complete the implementation of Badger Bakery. If you are unable to complete the implementation of Badger Bakery, complete this to the best of your ability.

Here, you will apply your knowledge of visual design to Badger Bakery. If a response asks you to upload a figure or attachment, include those underneath the `_figures` directory. Images can be included using the following markdown format: `![description of image](_figures/example.png)`

1. Using your knowledge of visual design, improve your Badger Bakery interface. **This means changing your React code.** Following, describe at least 3 different design elements *or* principles that you used in your improved design. Add annotated screenshot(s) of the interface to show these design elements *or* principles.

#### Design choices.
When styling the website, I was first thinking about the Gestalt Principles.
The Gestalt Principles are a set of psychological principles that describe how people perceive and organize visual elements into meaningful patterns and wholes. They include principles like proximity, similarity, closure, continuity, and figure-ground, which explain how our brains naturally group and make sense of visual information. These principles are fundamental in design and can help create more effective and cohesive visual compositions. - ChatGPT

1. To show that the cards are the important thing on the webpage, and that they are similar, added a dropshadow to make stand out. 
2. I also added equal spacing to them, to make them percieved as a group. The different background color there is slighty different from the rest, but not that different, while maintaning the same spacing, makes it feel special, and draws focus, while stile maintaning to be a part of the group.
3. The last thing I did was to sort the cards/products in alphabetical order, to make it easier for the costumers to look thru them.

### -------------------------------------------------------------
2. In design question 1, you were likely limited by your knowledge of React in what changes you could make. Now, think bigger. Use a hand-drawn or digital sketch to demonstrate an improved interface. Describe **3 elements and 3 principles**. You can re-use elements or principles from design question 1 as long as they are applied in a new way.

I would add pictures of all of the products, a more visual pleasing and less anonomous - and + button, a total order and a checkout button. The total order should preferable always sit at the button of the screen, so if we add more products than space on the page (so you have to scroll down to see them), the total order would be visible all the time.
Could also be cool to have a sticker stating which products are the best sellers and a map of the location. 

## Done! ðŸ¥³

**Be sure that you have completed BOTH the React and Visual Design portions of this assignment.**
